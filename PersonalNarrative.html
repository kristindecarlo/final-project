<p>In doing my final website I feel like I really utilized everything that I learned in class.  I made my final website into a project portfolio.  I wanted to make it something that I could show friends, family, or even future employers when I am looking for an internship.  The pages I made were a homepage, an about me page, a page with my resume, a contact information page, and a page Singapore experience page.  In my about me page I wanted to just share a little bit about things and myself I like.  The writing sample page and resume page are two pages I think would be relevant to future employers.  My resume page has information about my past work experience and the writing sample page has links to my published writings.  As I was making the pages I used a lot of skills I learned in class, such as coding, designing the pages, and bootstrap.</p>
    <p>A lot of thought went into the style of my web page.  I wanted to make a page that was fun and showed my personality, but was also clean, easy to read, and professional.  My favorite colors are pink and purple, so I wanted to be sure to include these.  One aspect I really like on my page is the header that is on top of every page.  For this I used a background image and then placed my name over it.  This background image is what decided the shades of pink and purple I used throughout my whole page since I included it on every page.  I got the font I used from Google fonts and also incorporated that throughout my entire website. I used margins of 30px on every page as well.  One thing that was really important to me was consistency throughout my website.  I want the person looking at it to focus on the content and not getting distracted by changes in design or too many crazy things going on each page.</p>
	<p>I used bootstrap in two different ways in my final website.  The first way I customized bootstrap was by making a navigation bar.  Once I got the template I just had to add different categories in it.  I decided to keep the search box in my website since I see it on many other websites I go in.  I ended up deleting a lot in the navigation bar because there were a lot more pages there that I did not need.  The other way I used bootstrap was to put my pictures into my Singapore experience page.  This was a bit harder for me, I ended up having to go on a website about css to learn how to do it.  I further customized it by having a different amount of pictures in each section, so I often had to add parts of the grid.  I also decided to center the grid because I thought that was what looked best.  On my homepage I put pictures in, and I did not use bootstrap for this. This was extremely hard for me.  I had to resize the pictures a bunch of times and float them and use a clear fix.  When I used bootstrap for the pictures I was able to put them in a container and edit all of the sizes more easily, and I did not have to figure out the perfect margins, padding, or anything else.  All I had to do was change the size of the pictures.  Adding pictures in was the hardest part of this project, but with bootsrap it was a little bit easier.</p>
	<p>One aspect of coding that helped me the most throughout this project was creating classes for my material.  I used more than one class in most pages as a way to organize my information.  Before this final project I really avoided classes because I thought they were complicated.  But, I didn’t realize how much easier they make editing CSS and doing styling.  If I hadn’t used classes on my final website my project would have been a disaster.  One other thing that helped me throughout this project was using the validator.  Normally I waited until I was done with the project to validate my work and see what was wrong, but this time I validated my work as I went.  I think this saved me a lot of time and energy because each time I only had a few errors apposed to waiting until the end and having so many errors and not knowing what to do.</p>
	<p>In the course of doing my final project, the project portfolio, I got to utilize all of the skills I learned in class.  I organized my content and design in my site prototypes, I used the coding I learned, and used a lot of styling and css.  Even though I had some trouble making this site, and this class was harder than I thought it would be, it was worth it and I made a site that I can be proud of.</p>
